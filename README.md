*You may find more explanation on full process on [this dedicated page](src/md-pages/explications.md) (in French)*

## Getting Started ðŸš€

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites ðŸ“‹

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.\
Also you need to have installed [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

## How To Use ðŸ”§

1. **Clone the source code.**

   Use Git to get the source code of the site:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:mabhub/bookmarklet-attestation-deplacement.git
   ```

2. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd bookmarklet-attestation-deplacement
   npm ci
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `bookmarklet-attestation-deplacement` directory in your code editor
   of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser
   will update in real time!
